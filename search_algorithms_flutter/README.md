# Search Algorithms

A Dart package that provides various search algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, Jump Search). This package is designed to help developers easily implement and compare different search techniques in their applications.

## Features

- **Linear Search**: Simple search algorithm that checks each element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found.
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Jump Search**: Search algorithm that combines linear and binary search techniques by jumping ahead by fixed steps and then performing a linear search within the interval.
